Four defensive shield spells are given on the Defense Against the Scary Spells
page of Larry's Spellbook.
Each shield has a seven-letter name (a non-sensical word),
and may be identified by its graph:


Likewise, offensive attack spells are described by sequences of ordered pairs
with vertical coordinates increasing toward \(\infty\).
Remember that an offensive attack spell defeats an sheild if infinitely-many
of the ordered pairs are below the graph of the defensive shield.
